```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation

```{r install, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(rstan)
library(devtools)
library(atsar)
# for optimizing stan on your machine,
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
```

## Data

We'll use the same data in the MARSS manual, from Mark's example in the Columbia River. The data are accessed with 

```{r}
library(MARSS)
data(SalmonSurvCUI)
```

### Fitting a univariate DLM

We can start with fitting a DLM that includes no covariates, but a random walk in the intercept (mean). 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
mod = fit_stan(y = SalmonSurvCUI$logit.s, model_name="dlm-intercept")
```

Next, we can fit a model with constant intercept, but time-varying slope.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
mod2 = fit_stan(y = SalmonSurvCUI$logit.s, x = SalmonSurvCUI$CUI.apr, model_name="dlm-slope")
```

Finally, we can fit a model with both a time varying intercept and a time varying slope. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
mod = fit_stan(y = SalmonSurvCUI$logit.s, x = model.matrix(lm(SalmonSurvCUI$logit.s ~ SalmonSurvCUI$CUI.apr)), model_name="dlm")
```

## Fitting non-normal errors

We've implemented several non-normal observation model distributions in `stan_fit`, including "binomial", "poisson", "gamma", etc. As an example of how to use these in a DLM setting, we'll fit a DLM with time-varying mean and Poisson response to a time series of ecoli data, collected weekly. The data are in the `tscount` package.

```{r}
y = tscount::ecoli
```

We could fit a Poisson GLM in `fit_stan` with the following,

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
mod = fit_stan(y=y$cases, x = model.matrix(lm(y$cases~1)), model="regression", family="poisson")
```

But the regression model assumes independent observations between time steps. To include the autocorrelation between time points, we can fit a DLM,

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
mod = fit_stan(y$cases, model="dlm-intercept", family="poisson")
```

This more flexible model captures the data much better. Note: the credible intervals are on the mean, not new data.
