The atsar R package implements Bayesian time series models using Stan, primarily for illustrative purposes and teaching (University of Washington's Fish 507, Winter quarters). The Stan webpage, and appropriate citation guidelines are [here](http://mc-stan.org/). 


### INSTALL {#install}

You can install the development version of the package with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nwfsc-timeseries/atsar")
```

### EXAMPLE {#example}

Simulate data:

```{r simulate}
library(rstan)
library(atsar)
set.seed(123)
s = cumsum(rnorm(50))
```

```{r plot}
plot(s)
```

Fit several models to this data:

```{r fit, eval = FALSE}
# Regression, no slope
regression_model = fit_stan(y = s, x = model.matrix(lm(s~1)), model_name="regression")

# Regression, with slope
regression_model = fit_stan(y = s, x = model.matrix(lm(s~seq(1,length(s)))), model_name="regression")

# AR(1) time series model
ar1_model = fit_stan(y = s, est_drift=FALSE, P = 1, model_name = "ar")

# ARMA(1,1) time series model
arma1_model = fit_stan(y = s, model_name = "arma11")

# univariate ss model -- without drift but mean reversion estimated
ss_model = fit_stan(y = s, model_name = "ss_ar", est_drift=FALSE)
```

To see the Stan mode code behind each of these, look in the `inst/stan` folder on the GitHub repository. Note that `fit_stan.R` does some data preparation to deal with Stan not accepting NAs in the data.
